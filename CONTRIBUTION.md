### Coding Guidelines

At Pixel Perks, we believe that clean and well-structured code is essential for maintainability and collaboration. Here are some coding guidelines to keep in mind while contributing:

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions. Avoid single-letter variable names or overly cryptic abbreviations. Code readability is crucial.

- Add comments when necessary to explain complex logic or non-obvious code behavior. Comments should provide context and help fellow developers understand your thought process.

- **Through Testing**
    - Write unit tests for your code to ensure it behaves as expected and to prevent regressions. Test both normal and edge cases to cover a wide range of scenarios.
    - Perform integration tests to verify that different components of the app work together seamlessly. This is especially important when making changes that affect multiple parts of the app.
    - Before submitting your code, run the existing test suite to ensure that your changes do not break any existing features or functionality.


By adhering to these coding guidelines, you'll contribute to a more maintainable and collaborative development environment for Pixel Perks.
